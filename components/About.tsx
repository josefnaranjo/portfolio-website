              I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from
              California State University, Stanislaus, in December 2023. During
              my time at college, I worked as an{" "}

                undergraduate research associate{" "}
              </span>{" "}
              in the computer science department, where I focused on artificial
              intelligence, data science, and neural networks. Since February
              2024, I have worked as a{" "}

                Full-Stack Software Developer{" "}
              </span>{" "}
              at Bay Valley Tech in Modesto, CA. This non-profit
              organization&apos;s mission is to support their community&apos;s
              growth and development in the technological field.

              I also worked as a{" "}

                Freelance Back-End Developer
              </span>{" "}
              for a healthcare startup, where I helped build and deploy a
              machine learning model to identify diseases from user symptoms
              using FAISS and Pinecone. This project deepened my experience with
              cloud technologies like AWS and Google Colab, and strengthened my
              back-end development skills.

              Not everything in life is about programming, though. I also enjoy
              learning about new emerging technologies on different internet
              platforms. In addition, I love working out, listening to music,
              and going on hikes occasionally. I need my dose of nature to keep
              me going!
